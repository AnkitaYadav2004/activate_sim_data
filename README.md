Data Validation: Basic validation for input data is implemented to prevent incorrect data submissions.

No Authentication: For simplicity, this version of the service does not implement user authentication. Future iterations should include JWT or OAuth for secure access.

Database Choice: MongoDB is used for its flexibility in handling unstructured data and ease of setup, but it can be replaced with any relational database if needed.

Error Handling: Simple error handling is included; however, it can be expanded to include logging and more detailed error responses.

Scalability: This service is designed to be a starting point. Future features like caching, rate limiting, and microservices architecture could be added to enhance performance and scalability.
